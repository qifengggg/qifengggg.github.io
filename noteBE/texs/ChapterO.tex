\subsection{单幅漫画}

A/An encouraging and thought-provoking story 
emerges from the image presented above: \textrm{(I)}
Apparently, the picture does mirror a common phenomenon in our contemporary society.

As a matter of fact, the picture
attempts to convey a crucial message:
\textrm{(I)} does count in \textrm{(I)} .
To put it more explicitly, it is undeniable that 
\textrm{(II)} (为什么需要XXX/XXX的重要性).
In such cases, \textrm{(III)} ought to \textrm{(III)}
(in order to \dots).
By contrast, should \textrm{(IV)} lack such awareness, \textrm{(IV)}
would be more likely to \textrm{(IV)} in the end.
A host of convincing examples can be found to illustrate my viewpoint.

On the whole, according to the analysis mentioned above, we could draw a reasonable 
conclusion that \textrm{(I)} are advised to cultivate/foster a sense of \textrm{(I)}
and put it into practice. Only in this manner can \textrm{(II)}.
